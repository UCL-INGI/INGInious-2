## how can I contribute?

Regarding your skills and knowledge, there is always something you can do to contribute to INGInious project. Here are some topics you can focus on.

### Reporting bugs

You found a bug? Before submitting a new issue, please have a look at some ressources :
- Check the [discussions](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious/discussions) tab for similar behaviour.
- Check the [issues](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious/issues) tab and especially closed [issues](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to see if an issue already exist (and so avoid duplication) and that it is maybe resolved.

Found nothing revelant? It's now time to open a new [issue](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious/issues/new/choose). 

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- Write a clear and descriptive title.
- Be explicit in the description
- Give the expected behaviour.
- Give all steps to reproduce the problem.
- Include screenshots or animated content.
- Put labels to define category of issue.

### Suggesting enhancements

Wanna suggest an enhancement? Just like issues, first have a look [here](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Feature+request%22) and [here](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+plugin%22) to see if someone have a similar idea. In that case just comment the existing issue with your ideas.

Once this verification is done, you can create a new issue juste like [reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs) part but pay attention to label it with *Feature request*.
